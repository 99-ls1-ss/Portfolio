                <p>
                    I have worked in the Real Estate software industry since 2003.
                    I continually strive to improve my abilities and skill set.

                    I enjoy researching my family genealogy.
                    My uncle created an extensive family tree before computers were common.
                    He did this by writing letters and mailing them to various libraries and courthouses asking for information.
                    When he passed away, I took up the reigns and continued researching my family history.
                    I have since digitized our tree on Ancestry.com and there are almost 3000 people in my tree.
